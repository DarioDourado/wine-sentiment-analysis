J. Lohr 2000 Hilltop Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),J. Lohr,Red,Hilltop Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$32 ,87,,"Held back nearly five years, this Cab still has some sturdy tannins, but I would drink it now because the fruit's in a precarious position. It's rich and tasty now in black currants and cherries, but too soft to age."
Antucura 2010 Pinot Noir (Vista Flores),Antucura,Red,,Pinot Noir,"Vista Flores, Mendoza Province, Argentina",15%,$17 ,85,Michael Schachner,"Rubbery, bold and earthy on the nose, then full and sticky in the mouth, with sweet black fruit flavors. Tastes more like a Bordeaux red wine than textbook Pinot Noir courtesy of heavy extraction, darkness and oak. Tastes good but could use a lesson in elegance and restraint."
Quinta do Portal 1999 Quinta do Portal Reserva Red (Douro),Quinta do Portal,Red,Quinta do Portal Reserva,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Douro, Portugal",,,90,Roger Voss,"Smoky, meaty aromas lead into perfumed fruit flavors. The tannins are soft but dry; the fruit is very aromatic with a touch of violets and some rich, dark tannins underneath. The wine will age well—probably 5–10 years. —R.V."
Tenuta di Ghizzano 2006 Il Ghizzano Red (Toscana),Tenuta di Ghizzano,Red,Il Ghizzano,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Toscana, Tuscany, Italy",13.50%,$18 ,86,,"The nose is rather neutral save for distant aromas of cherry fruit, boysenberry and spice. However, the mouthfeel is more interesting thanks to the wine's chewy succulence and fresh, zesty close: An 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot."
Tenuta San Francesco 2007 Tramonti White (Campania),Tenuta San Francesco,White,Tramonti,White Blend,"Campania, Southern Italy, Italy",13.50%,$21 ,85,,"This intriguing blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella (three relatively unknown indigenous grapes) has a candy- or soda-like quality that recalls butterscotch and caramel. However, those notes are balanced by an elegant mineral tone and the wine has good dimension on the close."
Las Positas 2011 Estate Barbera (Livermore Valley),Las Positas,Red,Estate,Barbera,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",15.10%,$40 ,89,Virginie Boone,"This is a hefty Barbera, replete with dark, brooding layers of rich cinnamon and anise, especially aromatically, and a chewy texture. Structured, it's leathery yet juicy, touched by oak, with a suggestion of petrol on the finish. But with Nonna's lasagne? Great."
Krupp Brothers 2007 The Doctor Red (Napa Valley),Krupp Brothers,Red,The Doctor,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",15.10%,$60 ,92,,"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky."
Yvon Mau NV Premius Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bordeaux),Yvon Mau,Sparkling,Premius Brut Rosé,"Sparkling Blend, Sparkling","Crémant de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France",12%,$19 ,88,Roger Voss,"Made in a traditional style, this is a fruity, crisp blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. With its freshness allied to the attractive strawberry flavors, the wine has both a ripe character and a buoyant mousse and aftertaste. Drink now."
Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),Gunter Triebaumer,Red,,"Blaufränkisch, Other Red","Burgenland, Austria",13%,$16 ,87,Roger Voss,"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap."
Ata Rangi 2016 Crimson Pinot Noir (Martinborough),Ata Rangi,Red,Crimson,Pinot Noir,"Martinborough, New Zealand",13.50%,$30 ,89,Christina Pickard,"Founder Clive Paton is a keen conservationist, and proceeds from the sale of this wine go toward Project Crimson, which replants threatened red-flowering trees around New Zealand. The nose is a little reductive, requiring a few minutes to get going in the glass, but when it does, it's quite fragrant, with bright red berry fruit, potpourri, floral, pepper and sap characters. It's medium bodied, and the juicy, slippery fruit is tightly wound with sappy, earthy tannins and slightly bitter oak spice. Drink now–2024."
Merry Edwards 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),Merry Edwards,White,,Sauvignon Blanc,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",14.10%,$32 ,88,,"Despite a chilly vintage, the winery successfully avoiding the green fruit that plagues so much Sauvignon Blanc from 2011. While the wine is dry, it's rich in citrus, pear, tropical fruit and honey flavors, with a touch of spicy oak."
Kaiken 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),Kaiken,Red,Reserva,Malbec,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14.50%,$13 ,87,Michael Schachner,"Brushy aromas of wild herbs along with cherry and plum scents feed into a fresh, fairly full palate. This is generously oaked for basic Malbec, and thus spice and resin notes share the stage with plum and blackberry flavors. A dry, spicy, resiny finish is the close."
Château le Prieuré 2007 Grand Cru Classé  (Saint-Émilion),Château le Prieuré,Red,Grand Cru Classé,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,$42 ,89,Roger Voss,"Situated on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, just east of the city, Château le Prieuré has produced a finely structured 2007, not big, but well balanced. Touches of cocoa and cinnamon spice cap the solid fruit and dry tannins. Age for 3–4 years."
Casa da Passarella 2012 Colheita Tinto Red (Dão),Casa da Passarella,Red,Colheita Tinto,Portuguese Red,"Dão, Portugal",13.50%,$15 ,88,Roger Voss,"A fresh and fruity, juicy wine that is just touched by the tannins and structure of the Dão region. It is a wine to be consumed young for its berry fruits and perfumed acidity. Drink now."
Leone de Castris 2018 Il Medaglione Primitivo (Salento),Leone de Castris,Red,Il Medaglione,"Primitivo, Zinfandel","Salento, Southern Italy, Italy",13.50%,$15 ,88,Alexander Peartree,"Aromas of blood orange, baked plum and cherry are lifted by potpourri spice on the nose. Rounded and juicy on the palate, a succulent red fruit jam flavor is honed by racy acidity and fine-grained tannins."
Jidvei 2015 Demisec Gewurztraminer (Jidvei),Jidvei,White,Demisec,"Gewürztraminer, Gewürztraminer","Jidvei, Romania",12.50%,$10 ,86,Jeff Jenssen,"This semisweet wine has a flowery bouquet of jasmine and citrus blossom. The florality continues to the palate, combining with flavors of pineapple, ginger and apricot before a slightly sweet finish."
Herdade do Rocim 2014 Vale da Mata Reserva Red (Lisboa),Herdade do Rocim,Red,Vale da Mata Reserva,Portuguese Red,"Lisboa, Portugal",13.50%,$35 ,94,Roger Voss,"From a small vineyard owned by the Vieira family for several generations, this wine is dense, impressive and packed with rich black fruits. Its tannins and smoky, tarry character are now almost mature, and the result is very fine. This major wine will be ready to drink from 2020."
Daou 2015 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Daou,Red,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",14.50%,$56 ,92,Matt Kettmann,"Deep and dark aromas of black currant, elderberry jam, dark chocolate and an elegant layering of herbs show on the nose of this bottling. There's a dense frame of opulent black cherry and purple flowers on the sip, which is framed by upright yet smooth tannins."
Laetitia 1999 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),Laetitia,Red,La Colline,Pinot Noir,"Arroyo Grande Valley, Central Coast, California, US",14.10%,$60 ,92,,"There's a complex mélange of aromas and flavors that one taster felt incorporated too many citrus and vegetal notes, but the rest of the panel enjoyed the cherry, herb, cocoa, cinnamon, citrus and olive notes. Smooth and polished, this combines structure and immediate appeal. Good now, but best after 2004."
Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),Bouchard Père & Fils,Red,Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,"Volnay, Burgundy, France",,$85 ,92,Roger Voss,"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity."
Winery of Good Hope 2011 Bush Vine Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),Winery of Good Hope,White,Bush Vine,Chenin Blanc,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",13%,$12 ,86,Lauren Buzzeo,"This wine shows good balance between the lively acidity and ripe notes of red apple flesh, pear and orange oil. The round mouthfeel of ripe fruit flavors are lifted on the finish by a tangy, green plum and lime zest accent. Drink now."
Château de Fieuzal 2013  Pessac-Léognan,Château de Fieuzal,Red,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Pessac-Léognan, Bordeaux, France",,$50 ,89,Roger Voss,"The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001."
Testarossa 2015 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),Testarossa,Red,Tondre Grapefield,Pinot Noir,"Santa Lucia Highlands, Central Coast, California, US",14.50%,$65 ,93,Matt Kettmann,"Plump mulberry and black plum aromas are generous but reserved enough on the edges to keep it elegant, lifted by spicebox and sweet tobacco touches. Lovely layers of flavors explode on the palate, with a strong spicy character lifting the core of dark red fruit. There's also an earthy flavor, and perfect acidity binding it all together."
A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines 2015 Ramnasgras Cinsault (Swartland),A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines,Red,Ramnasgras,"Cinsault, Other Red","Swartland, South Africa",11%,$40 ,90,Lauren Buzzeo,"Notes of rosehip, clove, nutmeg, red currant, rhubarb and wild strawberry all abound on the nose and mouth in this fresh, vibrant wine. Fine tannins lend a soft structure to the medium-weight palate, with bright acidity providing freshness and levity. Hints of Dr. Pepper and tart red currant ride out the mouthwatering close. Drink now–2021."
Château Potelle 2000 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),Château Potelle,Red,,Zinfandel,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California, US",,$22 ,85,,"This fine Napa producer has set up a Paso Robles operation and here is the result. This is a soft, hot country Zin, with plummy, raisiny flavors, considerable alcohol, and nonexistent tannins. The wine is dry, with a fruity finish."
Wombat Gully 2001 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),Wombat Gully,Red,,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",12.60%,$10 ,84,Michael Schachner,"Tight in the nose, with hints of tomato and black plum. The flavors veer toward plum and cherry, as there's quite a lot of fruit here. Furthermore, it's nice and easy on the palate. Some toasty oak appears on the finish, which is buttery and fairly long. —M.S."
Sallier de la Tour 2017 Inzolia (Sicilia),Sallier de la Tour,White,,"Inzolia, Italian White","Sicilia, Sicily & Sardinia, Italy",12%,$13 ,87,Kerin O’Keefe,"This 100% Inzolia has aromas of Bosc pear, white flower and Granny Smith apple. The aromas carry over to the easy-drinking palate accompanied by bright acidity that gives the wine a refreshing close."
Château Coutet 2004  Barsac,Château Coutet,Dessert,,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Barsac, Bordeaux, France",,,94,Roger Voss,"A fresh, delicious wine, the natural richness of the botrytis balanced beautifully with acidity. It is ripe but delicate, a style that floats over the sweet fruit."
Melville 2002 Clone 76 - Inox Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Melville,White,Clone 76 - Inox,Chardonnay,"Sta. Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US",,$28 ,86,,"An entirely unoaked wine designed to showcase its terroir, which it does in the tartly crisp acidity and streamlined citrus and apple flavors. The wine drinks severe and steely sharp. The bottle I tasted was also a little fizzy."
Geyser Peak 1999 Reserve Alexandre Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),Geyser Peak,Red,Reserve Alexandre Meritage,"Cabernet Blend, Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Alexander Valley, Sonoma, California, US",13%,$45 ,93,,"The quintessential Alexander Valley Cabernet, always dependably soft, fruity and complex. This year is one of the best ever. Plush and velvety, with endless nuances, it's like sipping the essence of black cherries steeped in kirsch. Dry, with just enough oak to add smoke and spice. Editors' Choice. —S.H."
Leonetti Cellar 2018 Holy Roller Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),Leonetti Cellar,Red,Holy Roller,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",,$138 ,94,Sean P. Sullivan,"Coming from the winery's plantings in the Rocks District, this wine is 83% Cabernet and 17% Sangiovese. The aromas are redolent with notes of dark fruit, dried herbs, moist earth, flowers, cocoa and spice. The black fruit flavors are dense and supple, displaying impressive intensity and more structure than is often associated with this region. The finish shows exceptionally long hang time."
Chalk Hill 2005 Botrytised Sémillon (Chalk Hill),Chalk Hill,Dessert,Botrytised,Sémillon,"Chalk Hill, Sonoma, California, US",11%,$55 ,95,,"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price."
Brokenwood 2008 Cricket Pitch Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot-Petit Verdot Red (South Eastern Australia),Brokenwood,Red,Cricket Pitch Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot-Petit Verdot,"Red Blends, Red Blends","South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",14%,$21 ,87,Joe Czerwinski,"Dark hints of charred oak and cola accent bright berry aromas, while the palate is marked by bold berry and black cherry flavors and a whack of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that comes across as a bit hard-edged because of its acidity despite having rather soft tannins. Drink now."
Silver Palm 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),Silver Palm,Red,,Cabernet Sauvignon,"North Coast, North Coast, California, US",13.70%,$19 ,86,Jim Gordon,"Jammy aromas, figgy flavors and a very smooth mouthfeel define this medium-bodied and straightforward wine. Without much of the typical tannins, it's easy on the palate."
Tittarelli 2003 Reserva de Familia Tempranillo (Mendoza),Tittarelli,Red,Reserva de Familia,Tempranillo,"Mendoza, Mendoza Province, Argentina",14%,$20 ,80,Michael Schachner,"The color and aromas stir intrigue, but the brutally sharp palate that runs on steam-roller acidity does it no favors. Succulent to the point of sour, and giant to the point of overdone, this wine needs to head back to the garage for a tune-up."
Innocent Bystander 2005 Shiraz-Viognier (South Eastern Australia),Innocent Bystander,Red,,,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",14.50%,$20 ,90,Joe Czerwinski,"This may only be a medium-bodied red, but it crackles with the exciting flavors of the northern Rhône, marrying freshly cracked peppercorns with a hint of meatiness and bright blueberry fruit. Drink now."
Angeline 2006 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino County),Angeline,White,,Gewürztraminer,"Mendocino County, Mendocino County, California, US",13.10%,$14 ,89,,"Well-acidified, the fruit shows a long hangtime character of marvelously intense tropical fruits, spices and flowers. The wine spreads a honeyed richness all around the mouth, but it's dry."
Cellers Unió 2014 Roureda Llicorella Clàssic Red (Priorat),Cellers Unió,Red,Roureda Llicorella Clàssic,"Red Blends, Red Blends","Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",14.50%,$25 ,90,Michael Schachner,"Drilling aromas of graphite and balsamic dark fruits open this intense, pulling blend of 50% Carignan, 25% Garnacha and 15% Merlot. Roaring berry, chocolate and pepper flavors get brushed aside by the tannic roughness of the finish. Give this plenty of air before pouring; drink through 2024."
Dopff Au Moulin 2017 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Dopff Au Moulin,White,,Pinot Blanc,"Alsace, Alsace, France",12.50%,$14 ,89,Anne Krebiehl MW,"A shy nose gives only slight glimpses of russet-pear peel and earth. The palate emphasizes a textural, earthy element with lemon crispness and finishes refreshingly dry and bright."
Palivou 2004 Ammos Terra Leone Single Vineyard Selection Agiorgitiko (Nemea),Palivou,Red,Ammos Terra Leone Single Vineyard Selection,"Agiorgitiko, Greek Red","Nemea, Greece",14%,$45 ,87,Susan Kostrzewa,"A darker, denser red that offers chocolate, black fruit and spice on the nose and palate. A spin of nutty spice and dried fruit punctuates the cherry and raisin fruit. Slightly Port-like and heavier, this wine will soften with time in the bottle."
La Ganghija 2015  Barbaresco,La Ganghija,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",14.50%,$45 ,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"Aromas of rose petal, red berry and tobacco lead the way. The juicy palate offers raspberry, white pepper and star anise set against firm tannins. Drink 2021–2029."
Château Pavie 2015 Arômes de Pavie Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),Château Pavie,Red,Arômes de Pavie Barrel Sample,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,"Saint-Émilion, Bordeaux, France",,,92,Roger Voss,"91–93. Barrel Sample. Spicy and ripe, this wine has a strong structure of brooding tannins. There are also great black plum and blackberry flavors here that are super-ripe."
Wyndham Estate 2007 Bin 333 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),Wyndham Estate,Red,Bin 333,Pinot Noir,"South Eastern Australia, Australia Other, Australia",13%,$9 ,86,,"Wyndham 333 delivers fabulous Pinot aromas of cherry, raspberry and mineral at a very modest price. The palate is serious, with lovely strawberry flavors but falls a bit flat on the plush finish. Drink up."
Château d'Aydie 2009  Madiran,Château d'Aydie,Red,,"Tannat, Other Red","Madiran, Southwest France, France",14%,$35 ,92,Roger Voss,"A new-wood-dominated wine, this has a heavy toast character, with extracted licorice and dark chocolate flavors as well as a big black-plum note. Rich and weighty, with juicy acidity, this demands many years of aging."
Kopke 2003 Colheita White  (Port),Kopke,Port/Sherry,Colheita White,"Port, Port Blend","Port, Portugal",20%,$51 ,89,Roger Voss,"Almost a baby in Colheita Port terms, this is a bright, ripe and fruity wine. It does have some touches of wood aging although they are left behind by the honey and orange marmalade flavors that have a light sprinkling of ginger. Drink now."
Chimney Rock 2005 Elevage Blanc White (Stags Leap District),Chimney Rock,White,Elevage Blanc,"Bordeaux-style White Blend, White Blend","Stags Leap District, Napa, California, US",13.50%,$39 ,92,,"Lots to like in this dry, elegant wine, which is a Graves-style blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. The flavors are quite complex, with nectarine, peach, pineapple and flowery buttercup accented with a nutty, cashew-rich oiliness. All that richness is perfectly balanced with crisp acidity."
Bellora 2016  Soave,Bellora,White,,"Garganega, Italian White","Soave, Veneto, Italy",12.50%,,85,Kerin O’Keefe,Fruity aromas of tropical fruit and white peach carry over to the simple palate along with the barest hint of bitter almond. Fresh acidity gives it a bright finish.
Bovio 2017  Barolo,Bovio,Red,,Nebbiolo,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",14.50%,$50 ,91,Kerin O’Keefe,"This opens with spicy aromas of incense and star anise that mingle with cedar and eucalyptus. The chewy palate offers dried cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside solid, somewhat grainy tannins. Drink through 2027."
Philo Ridge 2009 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Philo Ridge,Red,Unfiltered,Pinot Noir,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, California, US",14.10%,$34 ,87,Virginie Boone,"A light yet concentrated Pinot Noir, this has a cherry flavor and a spicy texture. Give it some air to allow the better side of its earthy aromas time to unravel."
La Selva 2008  Maremma,La Selva,Red,,"Ciliegiolo, Italian White","Maremma, Tuscany, Italy",13.50%,$28 ,86,,"Made from organically farmed Ciliegiolo (one of the great indigenous varieties of Tuscany), this opens with cherry and cured meat notes, and it shows a bright, tart quality on the finish."
